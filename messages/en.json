        "heritage_p2": "Today, those same techniques endure. We cure leather by seasons, not hours. We shape by hand, not machine. We sign each pair, because anonymity belongs to factories, not artisans.",

        "nomadic_label": "I. Nomadic Strength",
        "nomadic_p1": "Our ancestors rode for days across frozen plains. Their boots were not fashion—they were survival. The upturned toe, born from reverence for the earth, allowed a rider to slip free from the stirrup in a fall. Every curve had purpose. Every stitch, consequence.",
        "nomadic_p2": "This is the inheritance we carry: footwear forged not in showrooms, but in necessity. Leather cured to withstand temperatures that would crack lesser materials. Soles stitched by hand because machines cannot feel the grain.",
        "nomadic_p3": "We do not make boots. We make instruments for traversing the earth.",

        "italian_label": "II. Italian Refinement",
        "italian_p1": "Yet strength without grace is brutality. We learned this watching the great houses of Europe—how a single hem, cut one millimeter shorter, transforms presence. How negative space speaks louder than ornament. How restraint is the ultimate sophistication.",
        "italian_p2": "We apply this discipline to our heritage. Where tradition called for embellishment, we often choose silence. Where convention demanded color, we find power in patina. The Swiss movements of Furlan Marri taught us: what you leave out matters more than what you put in.",

        "master_p1": "In 1990, my father opened a small workshop in Ulaanbaatar. He had no business plan. He had only his hands—hands that had apprenticed under masters who remembered the old ways, before factories, before shortcuts.",
        "master_p2": "Thirty-five years later, those same hands still touch every pair we make. Not symbolically. Literally. He inspects each boot at three stages: after lasting, after stitching, after finishing. If the leather doesn't sing under his fingertips, it goes back.",
        "master_quote": "A machine can measure a boot. Only hands can know it.",
        "master_p3": "Presidents have worn his work. Champions have competed in it. But my father does not keep photographs with dignitaries. He keeps the lasts—wooden forms shaped to the feet of those he's served. Each one a conversation. Each one a promise kept.",

        "promise_p1": "A Domog boot is not a purchase. It is a partnership. We guarantee our craftsmanship for life—not because marketing demands it, but because our reputation requires it.",
        "promise_p2": "If a sole wears through, we replace it. If a stitch fails, we repair it. If the leather needs reconditioning after a decade of wear, bring it home. We remember every pair we've made. We honor every foot we've served.",
